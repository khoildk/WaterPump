# L298N Driver For STM32 
-This project is part of a smart irrigation system using the STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller.  
-It controls a mini water pump through the L298N motor driver (or MOSFET module) and can later be integrated with soil moisture and temperature sensors.  
-The goal is to automatically water plants based on environmental conditions.
# Features 
-Modular library for easy pump control (pump.h / pump.c)  
-Compatible with STM32CubeIDE and HAL libraries  
-Ready for future integration with sensors and IoT modules
# Prerequisites
-STM32 microcontroller (any series with SPI support)  
-L298N Module  
-STM32 development environment (STM32CubeIDE, Keil, etc.)  
-C compiler and toolchain  
-ST Link V2
